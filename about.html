                            <p>Unix plays an integral role in computing due to the fact that it provides a variety of functions. For instance, you can actively change, create and
                            delete files with ease using Unix. There are many more useful things that you can do with Unix, and this website will help
                            you understand how to utilize its effectiveness. Various commands are used to affect directories and files within a computer
                            system. These will be discussed in later in the website, but it is better to learn more about the history of Unix first.</p>

                            <p>As the old saying goes, everything has a beginning. Here, I will discuss the <em>genesis</em> of Unix and how it has evolved as time progressed.
                            Unix began in 1969, with its original name as <em>PDP-7</em>. Ken Thompson and a few others were key contributors to the beginning of Unix,
                            working with it in its early stage at Bells Lab. In 1973, it was rewritten in a programming language known as C, which facilitated its portability.
                            This, in turn, became a turning point in the history of operating systems. </p>
                            <p>In the 1980s, Unix systems became more noticeable in the industrial world, catching the attention industry analysts and researchers alike.
                            AT&amp;T, the company that owned Unix, utilized the system commercially during this decade. There were 750,000 Unix installations worldwide, which
                            signifed the growth and significance of the innovative computer system. In 1987, AT&amp;T and Sun Microsystems combined to form UNIX international.
                            Another large organization called Open Software Foundation commenced to take root. With different organiztions involved in what could be known
                            as the Unix wars, many versions began to be released to the public by the 1990s and so on. However, 2010 is the year that really reported the
                            exponential growth of Unix systems, which held the count of 50 million desktops that were using the certifed Unix systems.</p>
