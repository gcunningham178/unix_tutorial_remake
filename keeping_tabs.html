                                <p>So far, we have taken a look at how Unix can be used to organize files, print them, create directories, and perform other useful
                                functions. Commands, such as pwd, cd, ls, and many others, will help you a great deal if you use them correctly. Now that we viewed
                                some ways to personally improve your usage of Unix, how about expanding your horizon? Did you know that you can converse with someone
                                via Unix? Did you know that you can check your email? Even more interesting, did you know that you can even retrieve information
                                about other users? The answer to all three questions is yes!</p><br/>

                                <p>With one command, you can view all your e-mail messages as if you were logged onto your Yahoo account. With another command, you
                                will be able to have a typed conversation with another user right at your terminal. You will even be able to view information about the user,
                                such as phone numbers and addresses in a certain file. This page will show you the commands that will allow you to do all of the above.</p>

                                <p>There are multiple e-mail services on the Internet as we know it. You may be familiar with Yahoo, one of the most popular social networks on
                                the Web today. Students at universities, such as those attending Rochester Institute of Technology, interact with other students and faculty
                                via email. In other words, e-mailing has played a major role in society and has contributed to the increase in communication around the world
                                today. However, the Internet is not the only place where you can send e-mail to someone. This is where Unix comes into play. One command that
                                will allow you to send and view e-mails from anyone around the world is called the <em>elm</em> command.</p><br/>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-sm-6">
                                <p>If you are typing in the elm command for the first time, you will be asked whether or not you want to make a <em>.elm</em> or Mail
                                directory. Afterward, all of your messages will appear with the most recent one sent being first. What's more, the number of messages
                                and a one-line summary of each message will be shown using the elm command. Moreover, there are various sub-commands that are associated with
                                using the elm command. To navigate through the messages, use <em>k</em> to move up and <em>j</em> to move down. To respond to a current message,
                                use <em>r</em>. To mail a message, use <em>m</em>. Indeed you will be prompted to enter the email address of whom you're sending the message to.
                                Emacs will also start up for you to edit your message before sending it. Other sub-commands relating to elm can be found on this page

                                <p>Like the w and who commands, the finger command can be used to get information about the user. However, there are subtle differences in both the
                                amount and kind of information that the finger command gives. For instance, not only does it allow you to see who's logged in, but it also gives
                                even more information.</p>
                                <p>With the finger command, you can view the last time that the user read their email and other pieces of
                                information that are stored in a single file called <em>.plan</em>. In this file, people store practical information, such as addresses and phone
                                numbers. Using this command, you can also see this information displayed. You can also use the finger command on yourself, with which you can use
                                to view your own information.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-sm-6">
                                <p>The syntax and applied example for this command can be found below:</p>
                                <ul class="demo">
                                    <li><em>finger username</em></li>
                                    <li><em>finger gto5873</em></li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>While this command may seem useful, it may not work for all sites. There are some sites from which you will not be able to retrieve any
                                information at all. Also, the information that you receive with the command may vary from user to user. Nevertheless, the finger command
                                will list any information about the user that is available for display.</p>

                        <h1>The talk Command: Let's Talk About...Talking</h1><br/>
                         <div class="row">

                                <p>One cool feature of Unix is the fact that you can communicate with someone in a typed conversation straight from your own
                                terminal. Ever went on Facebook or any other social media and talked to a friend using instant messaging? This is pretty much the
                                same scenario. With the talk command, you can converse with another user. The only thing you would have to do in order to accomplish
                                this is specify the user name of whom you want to communicate with. The syntax for the talk command is as follows: <em>talk username</em>.
                                The command is indeed straightforward and allows you to <em>talk</em> with whomever you please. As long as that person has a Mac computer,
                                you will be able to converse with them via Unix.</p>

                                <h6>The write Command: I Type, You Read</h6>

                                <p>The write command is very similar to the talk command in the sense that it enables you to communicate with a chosen user. However, it is limited
                                compared to its counterpart. This is due to the fact that you can only exchange one-line messages with a user. The idea is still the same, but it's like
                                the "I talk, you listen and then talk" kind of approach to a conversation in the world of Unix.</p>

                                <p>The who command is very useful due to a few ways. One way is that you can find someone in a particular location, especially if they are in the
                                same building that you are occupying. Another way is that it tells you who is logged on and where they came from. You can pretty much say that it is
                                a form of keeping tabs. The syntax for the who command is rather simple: all you have to do is type in the command <em>who</em> when you are logged
                                on Unix. There is no file name or directory name that you have to type in after the command because of the simple fact that you are only requesting
                                information about the user.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h6>The w Command: Still Keeping Tabs</h6>

                                <p>The w command is very similar to the who command. It tells you who is logged on and where they came from. Even more intriguing is the fact that you
                                can see whether or not that person is at the keyboard typing at the same time that you are checking his or her status. Like the who command, there is
                                no need to type in a file name after the w command because you are not working with any files in this case.</p>
